### *A Decision Support System for Public Administration*

**Live Demo:** [Link to be added]

## 📋 Overview
This **Policy-Grade Analytics Dashboard** is designed for the District Collector (DC) and Planning Department of Baramulla. It serves as a unified command center to monitor, analyze, and intervene in the district's critical apple horticulture sector. 

Moving beyond static reports, this MIS (Management Information System) leverages data visualization to identify bottlenecks, simulate policy impacts, and track implementation roadmaps.

## 🚀 Key Modules
The dashboard is divided into strategic modules, each addressing a specific policy pillar:

1.  **Overview Command Center**: High-level KPIs (GSDP contribution, total production, revenue).
2.  **Production & Yield**: Comparative analysis of Traditional vs. High Density Orchards (HDP), highlighting the 5x income multiplier potential.
3.  **Climate & Risk**: Geospatial risk assessment for hail/frost, rainfall deficit tracking, and disease (Apple Scab) early warning calendars.
4.  **Exports & Logistics**: Supply chain visualization from "Orchard to Buyer," tracking value leakage and transport congestion peaks ("The October Crisis").
5.  **Market & Price**: Real-time price discovery (Sopore Mandi) and "Smart Selling" arbitrage calculations (Distress Sale vs. Storage).
6.  **Infrastructure (Storage)**: Cold storage gap analysis (177k MT deficit) and glut risk simulation.
7.  **Financial Inclusion**: Credit gap analysis (KCC saturation) and financial modeling for warehouse receipt financing.
8.  **Implementation Roadmap**: A 3-phase strategic plan (Stabilization, Productivity, Transformation) for 2025-2028.
